XGBoost  and Logistic Regression are two different machine learning algorithms used to create predictive models. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBMs) are another type of algorithm that is sometimes used to build predictive models. XGBoost is a modified version of GBM that is known to outperform traditional GBM models and is often used as the final model due to its improved performance. Therefore, the final model is built using XGBoost because it provides the best performance benefits.
